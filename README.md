Part 1: Fundamental Graph Theory Concepts
Before diving into problems, it's crucial to understand the basics:

1. What is a Graph?
A graph is a collection of nodes (also called vertices) and edges (connections between nodes).

2. Types of Graphs:
Type	Description
Directed vs Undirected	Edges have direction (â†’) or not
Weighted vs Unweighted	Edges may have weights (e.g., distances, costs)
Cyclic vs Acyclic	Graph may or may not contain cycles
Connected vs Disconnected	All nodes are reachable or not
Trees	Acyclic, connected, N nodes with N-1 edges

3. Graph Representation:
Representation	Description	When to Use
Adjacency List	{node: [neighbors]}	Space-efficient, most common
Adjacency Matrix	2D array	Good for dense graphs

4. Graph Traversals:
DFS (Depth First Search): Stack-based or recursive

BFS (Breadth First Search): Queue-based
